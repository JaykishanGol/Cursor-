# 🔧 Fix: Render Can't Find package.json

## The Problem
Your repository structure has the app in a subdirectory:
```
your-repo/
├── watchlist-app/     ← App is here
│   ├── package.json   ← Render can't find this
│   └── src/
└── README.md
```

But Render looks for `package.json` in the root.

## ✅ **Solution 1: Fix with rootDir (Easiest)**

**Update Render Settings:**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Edit your service settings
3. Set these values:

```
Root Directory: watchlist-app
Build Command: npm ci && npm run build  
Publish Directory: dist
```

**Or use the updated render.yaml** (I've created one in the root):
- The new `render.yaml` includes `rootDir: ./watchlist-app`

## ✅ **Solution 2: Move Files to Root (Recommended)**

Move all app files to the repository root:

```bash
# In your local repository
mv watchlist-app/* .
mv watchlist-app/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
rmdir watchlist-app

# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Move app files to root directory"
git push
```

**New structure:**
```
your-repo/
├── package.json      ← Now Render can find it
├── src/
├── dist/
└── README.md
```

## ✅ **Solution 3: Manual Render Configuration**

**Skip config files entirely:**

1. **Don't use render.yaml**
2. **Configure manually in Render dashboard:**
   ```
   Root Directory: watchlist-app
   Build Command: npm ci && npm run build
   Publish Directory: dist
   ```
3. **Add environment variables manually**

## ✅ **Solution 4: Alternative Deployment**

**Netlify (handles subdirectories better):**

1. **Zip your `watchlist-app` folder**
2. **Upload to Netlify**
3. **Or connect GitHub with:**
   ```
   Base directory: watchlist-app
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: watchlist-app/dist
   ```

## 🎯 **Recommended Fix**

**Option 2 (Move to root)** is best because:
- ✅ Works with all deployment platforms
- ✅ Cleaner repository structure  
- ✅ No subdirectory complications
- ✅ Standard practice for single-app repos

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

After fixing, your Render build should work with:
```
Build Command: npm ci && npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
```

The app itself is perfect - this is just a repository structure issue! 🎬✨
